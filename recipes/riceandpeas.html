        <p><strong>Ingredients List</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups long grain white rice (brown rice can be substituted)</li>
            <li>3/4 cups unsweetened coconut milk</li>
            <li>3 stalks scallions (AKA green onions)</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic chopped</li>
            <li>1 whole scotch bonnet pepper (AKA habanero) chopped</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups dried kidney beans canned kidney beans can be used as a substitute</li>
            <li>2 springs thyme dried</li>
            <li>1/2 tbs black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tbs salt</li>
            <li>7 whole allspice seeds (AKA pimento seeds)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>The first thing you must do if you're using dried kidney beans is to make sure you soak them overnight in a bowl of water.
                This softens the texture of the beans. I prefer dried beans, but you can use the canned kidney beans instead. 
                Drain the water from the beans and rinse thoroughly with water.</li>
            <li>Place your beans in a medium saucepan, add about 3 cups of water and boil for about 1 hr under a medium flame. 
                Your beans should now be tender (test by sticking a fork into one of them).</li>
            <li>While your beans are simmering, you can now add your unsweetened coconut milk, and stir for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Then you add your chopped garlic, scallions (green onions), thyme, allspice seeds and scotch bonnet pepper.</li>
            <li>Add your salt and pepper to the mix</li>
            <li>Stir under a medium-high flame for about 5 minutes or so. 
                Then you can add your rice and cook until the rice is cooked and fluffy, which takes about Â½ hr to 40 minutes. 
                There you have it, delicious Jamaican rice and peas.</li>
        </ol>
